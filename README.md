# Different prevalence:

To solve the problem of different prevalence that can be correlated with different genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles; 
In this study, we will use data from each prevalence area.


# The bioinformatic process

The script was simplified to be faster and easier to use. ( No coding skills needed)

# Final Script ( can be downloaded from the Script repertory)
